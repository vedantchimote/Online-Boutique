## Overview

Running Online Boutique in production requires proper monitoring, observability, and operational practices. This section covers everything you need to keep your application healthy and performant.

## What is Operations?

<Tip>
  **For Beginners:** Operations (often called "Ops") is about keeping your application running smoothly after it's deployed. Think of it like maintaining a car - you need to check the oil, monitor the engine, and fix problems when they arise.
</Tip>

Operations includes:
- **Monitoring**: Watching your application to know when something goes wrong
- **Observability**: Understanding what's happening inside your application
- **Maintenance**: Keeping everything up-to-date and running efficiently
- **Incident Response**: Fixing problems quickly when they occur

## The Three Pillars of Observability

```

### Metrics
Numbers that tell you how your system is performing:
- CPU and memory usage
- Request rate and latency
- Error rates
- Database connections

### Logs
Text records of what happened:
- Error messages
- User actions
- System events
- Debug information

### Traces
The path a request takes through your system:
- Which services were called
- How long each step took
- Where errors occurred
- Dependencies between services

## Online Boutique Observability Stack

Online Boutique comes with built-in observability using OpenTelemetry:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What's Included">
    - **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Collects metrics, logs, and traces
    - **Automatic Instrumentation**: Services automatically send telemetry
    - **Exporters**: Send data to your monitoring backend
    - **Service Mesh (Optional)**: Istio for advanced observability
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Supported Backends">
    You can send telemetry data to:
    - Google Cloud Operations (formerly Stackdriver)
    - Prometheus + Grafana
    - Jaeger (for tracing)
    - Datadog
    - New Relic
    - Any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What You Get">
    Out of the box, you can see:
    - Request latency per service
    - Error rates and types
    - Service dependencies
    - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
    - Distributed traces
    - Custom business metrics
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quick Start

Get started with monitoring in 3 steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy with OpenTelemetry">
    The OpenTelemetry Collector is included by default:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
    ```
    
    The collector is automatically deployed and configured.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Backend">
    Choose where to send your telemetry data:
    
    ```yaml
    # For Google Cloud
    env:
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: "https://cloudtrace.googleapis.com"
    
    # For Jaeger
    env:
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: "http://jaeger-collector:4317"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Data">
    Access your monitoring dashboard:
    - Google Cloud Console → Operations
    - Grafana dashboard
    - Jaeger UI for traces
    - Your chosen backend's interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Metrics to Monitor

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service Health">
    **What to watch:**
    - Pod status (Running, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.)
    - Container restarts
    - Readiness and liveness probe failures
    
    **Why it matters:** Tells you if services are up and healthy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request Rate & Latency">
    **What to watch:**
    - Requests per second (RPS)
    - P50, P95, P99 latency
    - Error rate (4xx, 5xx responses)
    
    **Why it matters:** Shows if users are experiencing slow or failed requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resource Usage">
    **What to watch:**
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory usage
    - Disk I/O
    - Network bandwidth
    
    **Why it matters:** Prevents resource exhaustion and helps with capacity planning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Business Metrics">
    **What to watch:**
    - Orders placed per minute
    - Cart abandonment rate
    - Product views
    - Checkout success rate
    
    **Why it matters:** Tracks actual business impact, not just technical metrics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
